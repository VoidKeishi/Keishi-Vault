# Keishi Vault

This is my personal knowledge base built using the Zettelkasten method in Obsidian, automatically backed up with Obsidian Git.

## About This Vault

This vault follows the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, which emphasizes:

- **Atomic notes**: Each note contains a single, focused idea
- **Connection-driven structure**: Notes are linked by concepts rather than rigid hierarchies
- **Organic growth**: The knowledge base evolves naturally through connections

## Vault Structure

- **Permanent Notes**: Processed, linked notes representing clear concepts
- **Literature/Reference Notes**: Direct citations and references from source materials
- **Fleeting Notes**: Quick, temporary thoughts to be processed later
- **Hub Notes**: Connection points that link related permanent notes by topic

## Workflow

My knowledge management follows this flow:
1. **Capture**: Record initial thoughts and information
2. **Connect**: Link new ideas to existing knowledge
3. **Crystallize**: Refine notes into clear, atomic concepts
4. **Create**: Use the network of knowledge to generate insights

## Benefits of This Approach

- Encourages deeper understanding through personal reformulation
- Facilitates creative connections between seemingly unrelated ideas
- Supports high-quality knowledge encoding similar to Bloom's Taxonomy
- Works with (not against) how the brain naturally forms memories

## Tools

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note management and visualization
- [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) for automated backups
