Greek tragedy, ==a cornerstone of Western drama==, features flawed protagonists facing fate, often with divine intervention, and explores themes of human suffering, free will, and the consequences of actions, as seen in plays like Oedipus Rex and Antigone. 

Key Characteristics of Greek Tragedy:

- **Flawed Protagonist:**
    
    The tragic hero, often of noble status, possesses a flaw (hamartia) or makes a mistake that leads to their downfall.
    
- **Divine Intervention:**
    
    The gods and fate play a significant role in the unfolding events, sometimes intervening directly or indirectly influencing the characters' actions.
    
- **Themes of Suffering and Fate:**
    
    Greek tragedies explore the human condition, focusing on themes of suffering, free will vs. fate, and the consequences of actions.
    
- **Chorus:**
    
    A group of characters who comment on the action, offer insights, and represent the voice of the community.
    
- **Spoken and Sung Narration:**
    
    Greek tragedies feature a blend of spoken dialogue and choral songs (ode) that enhance the dramatic impact.
    
- **Tragic Downfall:**
    
    The protagonist experiences a catastrophic fall from grace, often resulting in death or great suffering.
