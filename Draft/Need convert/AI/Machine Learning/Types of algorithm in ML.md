- Instance-based/Model based learning
# Supervised/Unsupervised
## Supervised learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Network (Can be unsupervised - like autoenconders)
## Unsupervised learning
- Clustering
	- k-Means
	- Hierachical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
	- Expectation Maximization
- Visualization and dimentsionality reduction
	- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
	- Kernel PCA
	- Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
	- t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Association rule learning
	- Apriori
	- Eclat
## Semisupervised learning
- Deal with partially labeled data
## Reinforcement learning
- Component:
	- An enviroment
	- An agent
	- List of actions
	- Rewards/Penalties
- Objective: Learn the best strategy - policy, to get most reward over time. Policy define which action to perform in each situation
# Batch and Online learning
## Batch learning
- Trained with all available data then launch into production - Offline learning
## Online learning
- Train incrementally, each step is fast and cheap
# Instance-Based/Model-Based
## Instance-Based
- Learning base on examples then apply on similar cases
## Model-Based
- Learning base on model of examples
